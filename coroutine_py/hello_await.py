# Manual Driving with send(): Using coro.send(None) to step through the coroutine manually, 
# which is useful for understanding the internals or when not using an event loop.
# Using asyncio.run(): Running the coroutine with asyncioâ€™s event loop, which is the standard way to execute async code in Python applications.
